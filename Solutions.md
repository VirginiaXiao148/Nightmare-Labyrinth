# Camera
If your game is freezing, it could be due to a number of reasons. Here are a few things to check:

Make sure the player GameObject is assigned in the Inspector.
Check if there are any errors in the Console.
Try to isolate the issue by disabling other scripts to see if this script is causing the problem.
Use Unity's Profiler to see if there are any performance issues.
Check if the freezing occurs when the camera collides with an object. If so, you might need to adjust your collision detection code.
